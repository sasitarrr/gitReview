        <p class="paragraph-one"><em>Bangkok</em> is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. It is known in Thai as 
        Krung Thep Maha Nakhon or simply Krung Thep. The city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres 
        (605.7 sq mi) in the Chao Phraya River delta in central Thailand and has a population of over 
        eight million, 12.6 percent of the country's population. Over fourteen million people 
        (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding <em>Bangkok</em> Metropolitan Region at the 2010 census, 
        making <em>Bangkok</em> the nation's primate city, dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size 
        and importance to the national economy.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-two"><em>Bangkok</em> traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 
        15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: Thonburi in 
        1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782. <em>Bangkok</em> was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, 
        later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the 
        West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th 
        century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and 
        underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through 
        the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, 
        media and modern society.</p>
